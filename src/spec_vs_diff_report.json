  "summary": "Diff adds PWA manifest + meta tags, a service worker with offline page, and new UI entry points (“Get the App” nav item, hero CTA, and a dedicated “Get the Boostly App” section with install prompt handling). However, the diff does not show the required icon image files being added, and the offline caching strategy does not clearly precache the main JS/CSS app shell bundles as requested. Several unrelated content/search additions appear beyond the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Provide the required PWA icon image assets (512x512, 192x192, apple-touch 180x180, favicon 32x32) in the repository so they can be served and referenced by the manifest/HTML.",
      "reason": "The manifest and HTML reference icon paths under /assets/generated, and the service worker precache list also references these images, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added/modified (likely binary and therefore absent from the LLM-readable diff). From the provided diff alone, the required images are not evidenced as present.",

      "requirement": "Cache the main app shell (main HTML/CSS/JS bundle) and static generated assets so that after one successful load, revisiting offline loads an offline-capable app shell (not just a standalone offline document).",
      "reason": "The service worker precaches '/', '/index.html', and some images plus offline.html, but it does not explicitly precache the built JS/CSS bundle assets. The navigation handler falls back to offline.html rather than serving the SPA shell when offline. Based on the diff summary alone, the requirement to cache the main HTML/CSS/JS bundle for an offline-capable app shell is not clearly implemented.",
