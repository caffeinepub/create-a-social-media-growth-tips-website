However, the requested generated icon set usage is not evidenced, and several unrequested backend/auth-related additions were introduced.",

      "requirement": "Use generated static images for both the hero illustration and small section icons, stored under frontend/public/assets/generated and referenced by the UI.",
      "reason": "The hero image is referenced, but section icons appear to be emojis (and other icon libraries), and there is no evidence that the required generated icon set image (social-icons-set.dim_512x512.png) is referenced/used. Also, the diff summary does not show the generated images being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (files may be omitted/truncated, so only the missing icon usage is asserted).",
