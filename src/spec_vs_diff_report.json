  "summary": "Implemented a configurable Cash App payment URL and updated the Payments/Monetization section to use a Cash App-first flow with clear “Boostly links out; Cash App processes payments” copy, including disabling the CTA and showing a setup message when not configured. Evidence for the requested FAQ update is not present in the provided diff excerpt.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-37",
      "requirement": "Update the existing payments FAQ entry to reflect the Cash App-only payment flow and to explicitly state that Boostly does not process payments and that payments are completed on Cash App.",
      "reason": "Although `frontend/src/content/siteContent.ts` is shown as modified, the provided truncated content does not include any FAQ entry changes related to payments, so the update cannot be verified from the diff summary.",
      "evidence": [

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added/retained payment click tracking UI (showing “{cashAppClicks} clicks” badge) tied to `usePaymentClickCounts`, including recording clicks before opening the link.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on routing to a configurable Cash App destination and updating copy/CTA/FAQ; it does not request click analytics or click-count display in the Payments/Monetization UI.",
