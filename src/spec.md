# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a responsive, single-entry marketing website that provides scannable, practical tips for growing a social media account.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a landing page at the root route with top navigation and these sections: Hero/intro, Core growth tips, Platform-specific tips, Tools & resources, FAQ.
- Add practical guidance subsections for: profile optimization, content strategy, consistency/scheduling, engagement/community, hashtags/SEO, analytics/iteration, and cross-promotion/collaboration.
- Include at least one actionable checklist (e.g., profile checklist or weekly growth routine) using concise bullets/short paragraphs.
- Add a prominent primary CTA button in the hero that scrolls to the main tips (or resources) section on mobile and desktop.
- Apply a consistent visual theme (colors/typography/spacing/component styling) suitable for a growth guide, avoiding a blue+purple dominant palette.
- Integrate generated static images (hero illustration and section icons) from `frontend/public/assets/generated` and reference them in the UI.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can open a shareable landing page, navigate across clear sections, and quickly read actionable growth tips, checklists, tools/resources, and FAQs, with a CTA that jumps them directly to the key tips.
