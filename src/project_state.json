    "Search indexing/keywords should cover broad topic-based queries (not limited to platform names), mapping searches to relevant guidance sections/content.",
    "Search indexing and content taxonomy should include explicit content-type categories (e.g., personal/real-life, mental health/emotional, educational, entertainment, aesthetic/creative, music/audio, fashion/beauty, motivational/inspirational) and allow matching across multiple platforms (TikTok/Instagram/YouTube/Snapchat) rather than platform-only queries.",
    "Monetization is now in scope: evaluate supported payment providers (e.g., Apple Pay via a processor like Stripe) and/or click-based revenue mechanisms (ads/affiliate links) including attribution/tracking requirements.",
    "Monetization scope expansion: implement in-app/website subscription plans with two tiers (monthly $6.00, annual $15.99) and ensure checkout displays no tax.",
    "Payment flow decision: payment CTAs should be simple outbound links that take visitors directly to the site owner’s Cash App payment page (no in-app/on-site payment collection or storing personal account details).",
    "Cash App payment destination URL provided: https://cash.app/$RenaeT13 (use as the outbound payment link for subscription CTAs if applicable).",
